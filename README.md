# Databases reference materials

This repository contains examples, exercises solved by me and information from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) [databases course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Home/Databases/Engineering/about) taught by Professor [Jennifer Widom](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/). I will use the repository as a place for consolidating this knowledge so material from other sources and my own findings will be included in the future.
